The myFoodQA dataset captures 1,500+ curated Myanmar dishes with paired visual
and textual descriptions sourced across regions. We annotate multiple
reasoning-intensive tasks (cultural context, ingredient-level grounding,
recommendations, and visual QA) to evaluate multimodal systems in low-resource
settings. The paper details our collection pipeline, evaluation splits, and
baseline models, and it has been accepted as a FULL paper for presentation at
the 7th Workshop on Innovation Initiatives in NLP/AI/Education (IINAE 2025)
co-located with iSAI-NLP 2025.
