## About me
I am a Computer Science student with a strong foundation in core CS principles and a deep passion for Artificial Intelligence. I have hands-on experience in multiple AI projects, including a Fruit Freshness Detection system (Samsung Innovation Campus AI Hackathon 2024 Winner Project), a Mental Support Chatbot, a Skin Condition Detection system with personalized skincare advice, and an AI-powered warehouse management system for sales prediction and faulty product detection (Code2Career Hackathon 2024 Winner Project).

In addition to AI, I have experience with Java, PHP, Python, C++, and JavaScript, plus database management, web development, software engineering, and algorithms. I’m eager to contribute to innovative AI projects and continue advancing my expertise.
